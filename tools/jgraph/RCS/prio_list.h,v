/* Priority lists are just like normal lists of list.h and list.c, except
 * that their third field is a (int) prioriy.  The routines of list.c should all
 * be used except for insert, because it will always put an item at the 
 * end of a list.  Instead, use prio_insert, which will put the item
 * into its proper place in the list.  The last argument of prio_insert should
 * be TRUE if the list is to be kept in descending order; it should be FALSE
 * for ascending order.

 * Priority list should be:

struct prio_list {
  struct prio_list *flink;
  struct prio_list *blink;
  int prio;
  ...
  }

  10/15/2012: prio_lists are the true embarrassing feature of jgraph
              -- an n^2 algorithm?  For shame.  I always say that
              I'll fix it someday, but I doubt that's going to
              happen.
