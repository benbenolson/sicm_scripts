This from Alan S. Raskin:

You may be interested in knowing what it takes to get jgraph to compile
MS-DOS/MS-QuickC:

1) Ignore all of the "function should return a value" warnings.  :-)
2) Use the blank VMS templates for popen and pclose in token.c
3) Define float=double to avoid math-overflow run-time errors.
