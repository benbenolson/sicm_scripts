$Revision: 8.3 $

------------------------------------------------------------
Comments in October, 2012:

Jgraph is a Unix graphing package that produces postscript.  I was pretty proud that 
jgraph was unmodified for over 19 years (November, 1992 to October, 2012), but
C compilers finally "progressed" to the point where my old-style C finally choked.
So I fixed it in October of 2012, and it's back humming along, although that was
some pretty disgusting code that I wrote as a graduate student in 1989.

In the new revision, besides getting jgraph to compile and not seg fault, I've
put it under the New BSD License. 

If you use jgraph, please drop me a quick email at plank@cs.utk.edu.  Documentation
of usage of my open-source code is always a good thing for department heads, 
deans and funding agencies.  Thanks -- Jim

Jgraph takes the description of a graph or graphs in the standard
input, and produces a postscript file on the standard output.  Jgraph
is ideal for plotting any mixture of scatter point graphs, line
graphs, and/or bar graphs, and embedding the output into LaTeX, or
any other text processing system which can read postscript.

The graph description language is simple enough to get nice looking
graphs with a minimum of effort, yet powerful enough to give the user
the flexibility to tailor the appearance of the graph to his or her
individual preferences.  This includes plotting multiple graphs and
laying them out separately on the page (or pages). 

The program is written in C, and shouldn't take anything too fancy
or machine-dependent.  It has been tested on DECstations, 
sun3's, and sparc's (and is being used on many other types
of machines, including those running VMS and DOS).

There is a makefile, a man page (in jgraph.1), source code, and 
example graphs.

Jgraph is available at http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/jgraph/jgraph.html

Please send me comments and/or bug reports.
